# Serge mocks library

This is where all of the reusable mock data for the serge project lives. 

## Please adhere to the following rules:

- Only use JSON for mock data 
- Do not modify existing mock data
- Only add mock data that is reusable across multiple components/views. Component specific mocks should reside with their components.
- Only mock the data needed for the test/story you are writing
