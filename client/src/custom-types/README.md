# Serge Custom Types library

This is where all of the reusable custom type data for the serge project lives. 

## Please adhere to the following rules:

- Only add reusable custom types to the library, component specific types should reside with their components
- Only add the types required for your use
- Be cautious about modifying existing types, see where they are previously used and perform thorough manual regression tests.
